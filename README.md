Mod for the game Minecraft.
Supports versions 1.21.4 and 1.21.5.

The multiplayer menu displays a list of servers that the user added manually and servers whose information was retrieved from the local network.

As for the latter, unlike manually added elements, they lack information about the number of players on the server, its version and the latency to it.

This mod is intended to eliminate this difference: now all elements are displayed the same, regardless of the source.
